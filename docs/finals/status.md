# Phase 0 — correctness pass: progress log

Session started 2026-10-11 (Claude Fable 5.1). Branch `finals`, baseline commit `1c4475f`.
One entry per milestone: time (UTC), phase/milestone, files, tests actually run with their
result, and the specific next step. If this session stops, resume from the last "next" line.

Fix order (from `docs/finals/prompt-0-correctness.md`): governance (1, 2) → ground truth (3) →
thresholds (6) → leakage (4) → edge parity (5) → analysis reuse (7) → demo prep → training
substance (model card, AutoML Studio view, AI4I rerun, Bolt eval case).

## 2026-10-11 — start: orientation and baseline

- **Phase:** 0 / orientation.
- **Done:** read CLAUDE.md §7 and §15, the brief, and every file named in the seven defects
  (`orchestrator.py`, `routes/approvals.py`, `routes/fleet.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `checks.py`,
  `automl.py`, `features.py`, `profiling.py`, `edge/*`, `replay.py`, `cost.py`, tests).
  All seven defects re-verified against the code at `1c4475f`.
- **Files changed:** `docs/finals/status.md` (this file).
- **Tests:** full `pytest` baseline running in the background (result recorded in the next entry).
- **Next:** fix 1+2 (governance): split maintenance approval from model promotion in
  `orchestrator._finalize`, open promotion requests only for passed validation, gate
  `lifecycle.request_promotion`/`promote` on `validation_passed`, fix `reject_promotion` call in
  `routes/approvals.py`; add tests; commit.

## 2026-10-11 13:45 UTC-5 — fix group 1 done: governance (defects 1, 2)

- **Baseline:** `pytest` at `1c4475f`: 180 passed in 48 s (full suite, e2e included).
- **Commit:** `e797f21` "Separate maintenance approval from model promotion and gate promotion
  on validation".
- **Files:** `apps/api/orchestrator.py` (`_validate`, `_finalize`), `apps/api/routes/approvals.py`
  (`decide_promotion_db`, `feature_spec_for_version`), `agents/mlops/lifecycle.py`
  (`validation_failures`, `PromotionBlocked`, `_assert_promotable`), `CLAUDE.md` §6,
  tests in `test_orchestrator.py`, `test_api.py`, `test_mlops.py`, `test_e2e_pipeline.py`.
- **Tests run:** `pytest tests/test_mlops.py tests/test_orchestrator.py tests/test_api.py
  tests/test_e2e_pipeline.py` → 41 passed (after fixing two new tests); `ruff check .` clean.
- **Next:** fix 3 (ground truth): strip `health`/`failure_within_h`/`regime` at the replay's
  publish boundary, `health_score: None` when no prediction, infer `regime` from rpm/load with
  the production baseline, scrub asset/telemetry/copilot responses, isolation test, web types.

## 2026-10-11 13:56 — fix group 2 done: ground truth isolation (defect 3)

- **Commit:** `6af028b` "Keep simulator ground truth out of every operational path".
- **Files:** `apps/api/schemas.py` (`ObservedTelemetryRow`, `GROUND_TRUTH_COLUMNS`, nullable
  `FleetAsset.health_score` + `prediction_ts`/`model_version`), `apps/api/db.py`
  (`latest_prediction_rows`), `apps/api/routes/fleet.py` (no fallback health, `infer_regimes`),
  `apps/api/routes/telemetry.py`, `apps/api/orchestrator.py` (copilot tools/templates,
  feature spec passed to `register_model`), `agents/mlops/lifecycle.py` (`feature_spec` payload,
  `production_feature_spec`), `agents/ml_architect/features.py` (`assign_regime_ids`),
  `streaming/replay/replay.py` (`public_record`/`public_payload`), web types + Fleet/Asset360/
  HealthPill/MotorSprite, `docs/INTERFACES.md`; new `tests/test_ground_truth_isolation.py`.
- **Tests run:** `pytest` on isolation, api, telemetry_routes, orchestrator, mlops,
  replay_work_orders, ml_architect → 77 passed; `ruff check .` clean;
  `npm run build` ok; `npm run test` 4 passed.
- **Next:** fix 6 (thresholds): named `CLASSIFICATION_THRESHOLD` (0.5) and
  `EARLY_WARNING_THRESHOLD` (0.3) in `apps/api/schemas.py`, one lead-time definition (3 sustained
  rows at 0.3) shared by `automl.py` and `checks.py`, `cost.py` window limit = early warning,
  thresholds reported in `ValidationReport`, Asset 360 chart draws both; test.
